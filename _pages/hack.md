## What is SERT Smash?

SERT Smash is a Hackathon located in Eugene, Oregon open to all high-school
students. There will be various challenges and awards for the winners.

## Who's invited?

All high-school students are invited to participate in the SERT Smash
competition. No FRC or robotics experience is required, but it will be a great
programming team bonding exercise for coding teams.

## How will it work?

At 8:00 AM on May 20th, 2017, the various challenges will be announced and
teams may begin working on their challenge entry. Teams may consist of up to 8
students and an adult member.

Throughout the day, teams may work on their code and create their entry. We
encourage teams to create a private GitHub repository to keep track of their
code changes and make collaboration easy, though other code collaboration
platforms may be desired depending on the challenge.

At the end of the day, teams will create a Pull Request to the SERT Smash
GitHub repository in order to enter their code. All code will be released under
the MIT license. Teams will then be asked to talk give a short demo and talk
about their project. Afterwards, the winners will be decided and announced.

## Where is it located?

SERT Smash will be located in Eugene, Oregon at South Eugene High School.
