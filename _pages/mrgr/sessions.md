## Integrating STEM Clubs and Activities into Curriculum — 3:30pm-4:30pm — Room 202
This panel will investigate how the STEM skills developed by robotics students can be recognized in their schools. Why is it beneficial for both schools and students to recognize, and even include these "outside" skills into classrooms? What are the potential benefits to other students, and what resources/practices do schools/clubs/activities need to further the integration.
