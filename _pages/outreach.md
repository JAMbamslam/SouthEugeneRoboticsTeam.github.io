## Upcoming Demonstrations

We will be demonstrating our Aerial Assist robot, Byter, at Kids Down South Preschool on February 1st.
On February 13th, we will be demonstrating the same robot and presenting about our team at the Emerald Valley Assisted Living Center. 

## Past Demonstrations

 SERT maintains its longstanding partnerships with the community by  frequently participating in events that raise awareness of FIRST 
 and STEM values. For the past three summers, we have participated in the Mini Maker Faire at the Science Factory, our local children’s 
 science museum, where more than 50 kids of all ages drove our Aerial Assist robot, Byter, and learned about FIRST. After that, our team
 set up a popular hands-on exhibit for three days at the well-attended Lane County Fair and gave community members the opportunity to drive
 our robots, an annual SERT event. At the Oregon State Fair, we participated in a FIRST exhibit with our robot and taught children and 
 parents from around the state about FIRST and the opportunities available to FIRST teams. Additionally, our team was invited to the Second 
 Star Festival in Florence, Oregon where we gave TED-style talks and demonstrated a previous season’s robot design. In November, our team
 participated in the Barnes & Noble Maker Faire and taught many children about robotics, a continuing event.
