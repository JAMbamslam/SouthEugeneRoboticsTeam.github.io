Alluminati competed at BunnyBots 2017, where it worked to extract stuffed bunnies from
five gallon buckets and push them to one side of the field. Since SERT gained many new 
members in 2017, the robot was used to train them by allowing them to work on an 
actual competition robot. This was SERT's first robot to compete at BunnyBots.

Gary Spice, our robot from FIRST Stronghold, was originally a high-shooter but was
modified to a low goal scorer during competition season. This robot was our first
time using treads, which was an interesting and educational experience for our team.

Nessie, from 2015's Recycle Rush, was made from recycled parts and lead the team to
World Championships for the first time in our team's history. This robot's rotating
belt with 3D printed hooks picked up and stacked both totes and bins. Nessie won us
both the Creativity and the Engineering Inspiration Awards at regional levels.

{: .robot-text .left}
Byter, from 2014's Aerial Assist was able to quickly score balls in the low goal and
sometimes even catch. The consistency of this robot took us to District
Champtionships and remains a favorite for community demonstrations due to its
sturdiness and interactive possibilities.
