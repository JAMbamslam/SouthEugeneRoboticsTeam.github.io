After three days of intense competition at the FIRST World Robotics Championship in Houston, SERT advanced to the semi-finals and ended the competition ranked 4th in our 64-robot division!

This was SERT’s second appearance at the world championships since the team’s inception in 2007, and the first time we’ve advanced to the playoffs.

The late-April competition capped a roller-coaster, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biter of a Cinderella season. There were ups. There were downs. There were times when we over-performed our own high-expectations. There were bitter disappointments when things didn’t go our way.

But our seven-foot tall, 120-pound robot, Poe, came to play, not go home. 

SERT went toe-toe with dozens of talented Pacific Northwest teams,  most forged in the high-tech meccas of Seattle and Portland. And Poe not only held its own, Poe prevailed, chalking-up win-after-win in the PNW Championships and giving us the chance to play with and against elite teams from all over the world in Houston.

There’s so much to say about how this amazing season came together. Best? Everyone had a hand in getting SERT to Worlds.

Our business team put together an amazing presentation showcasing our community outreach efforts over the year, which won SERT the coveted Chairman’s Award, FIRST Robotics' highest award. Points awarded for that win were added to competition points we scored thanks to a great robot design, solid fabrication, some awesome robot driving, and of course elegant programming that scored us important “autonomous” points (when the robot drives itself).

Key to our success this year was having the resources to build a second, practice robot, something all teams competing at the highest level do. This allows team members to continue to hone their programming and driving skills even after the competition robots gets boxed up and set aside.

And that happened because we had tremendous sponsor support. So, a huge shout out to the sponsors who donated tools, materials and money to our effort. This win is yours, too!

And a big shout out to our alliance partners! As captains of the third-seeded alliance, we chose D-Bug (team 3316), Ravonics Revolution (team 1710), and fellow PNW team Xbot (team 488) to battle alongside us. 

Thank you to our partners, sponsors, family and all the friends of SERT for a fantastic finish to the season!
