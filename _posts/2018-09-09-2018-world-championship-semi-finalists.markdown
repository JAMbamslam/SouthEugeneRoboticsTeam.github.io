After four days of intense competition at the 2018 FIRST World Championships in Houston, TX, SERT has finished as semi-finalists within the Roebling division! As captains of the third-seeded alliance, we chose alliance partners D-Bug (team 3316), Ravonics Revolution (team 1710), and fellow PNW team Xbot (team 488). Thank you to our partners for a fantastic finish to the season!
