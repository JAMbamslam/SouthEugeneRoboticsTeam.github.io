During the beginning weeks of summer break, the team has continued to meet on Tuesdays and Fridays from four to six PM. The main focus has been on fundraising in preparation for the upcoming season, as well as attending events aimed at promoting STEM and robotics to our community. The team ran a carwash on July 8th and made $558.88, thanks to many people’s generosity. Another carwash is currently being planned and is set to take place this coming Sunday, July 27th, and another on August 5th. SERT has established a fundraising opportunity with the Eugene Emeralds baseball team: if SERT members sell 200 tickets through our event’s portal, 50% of these ticket’s value will go to SERT. The business team has organized and promoted these fundraising events, communicating with external organizations, promoting events through posters and social media, and communicating expectations to the rest of the team.

The programming team has been maintaining code for the robots, keeping them up to date for events and exhibitions. Da Vinci Days, a festival that celebrates STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) at the Benton County Fairgrounds, takes place on July 21, 2018. We will be driving our robot and demonstrating our Go Baby Go trucks to visitors.

Girl’s Con was on June 30th, at Ophelia’s Place, a a prevention-based nonprofit organization that guides girls ages 10-18 towards healthy life choices. Members of the team were getting the girls more interested in robotics and STEM.
