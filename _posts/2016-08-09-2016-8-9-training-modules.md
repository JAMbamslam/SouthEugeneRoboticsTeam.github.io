For the second time, we will be holding training modules for new team members and others
that are interested in expanding their skill sets. There will be modules for mechanical,
electrical, CAD, business, and software. Modules will begin after Club Day and continue
on until winter break. Come and join us to gain valuable skills related to each subteam
to use during Build Season, or just to expand your own knowledge!
